## Rowkey design

### Monotonically Increasing Row Keys/Timeseries Data

<div class="alert alert-warning">
in general it's best to avoid using a timestamp or a sequence (e.g. 1, 2, 3) as the row-key
The key format in OpenTSDB is effectively [metric_type][event_timestamp]
</div>

### Try to minimize row and column sizes

### Reverse Timestamps

<div class="alert alert-warning">
the technique involves appending (Long.MAX_VALUE - timestamp) to the end of any key, 
e.g., [key][reverse_timestamp].
</div>

### Rowkeys and ColumnFamilies

<div class="alert alert-warning">
rowkeys 限定在ColumnFamilies中，因此一个表中多个ColumnFamilies可能存在相同的rowkey
</div>

### rowkey的不变性

<div class="alert alert-warning">
在表中它们可以被“改变”的唯一方式是，如果该行被删除，然后重新插入
</div>

### Relationship Between RowKeys and Region Splits

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Pre-splitting tables is generally a best practice, but you need to pre-split them in such a way that all the regions are accessible in the keyspace.
</div>

While generally not advisable, using hex-keys (and more generally, displayable data) can still work with pre-split tables as long as all the created regions are accessible in the keyspace.
